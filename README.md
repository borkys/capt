The recommended IrfanView Portable can be found on the official download site: https://www.irfanview.com/download_sites.htm

 2.1. Recommended option: Install IrfanView portable into the same directory where the capt_start.bat is located. Normally it is just enough to press Next,Next...Next in the installer. If this option chosen - congrats making your life easy - you are ready to go.
